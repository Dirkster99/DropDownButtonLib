Download from [nuget](https://preview.nuget.org/packages/Dirkster.DropDownButtonLib/)

There are sample screenshot on the Codeplex site from were this project is migrated from:
https://dropdownbuttonlib.codeplex.com/

This project is based on the drop down control contained in the
Extended WPF Toolkitâ„¢ Community Edition:https://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/ from Xceed.
It includes some bugfixes to the original implementation and extends the original controls with a:

- DropDownButton, SplitButton

with:

- DropDownItemsButton, SplitItemsButton

controls. The original implementation (DropDownButton, SplitButton) can be used to drop down and interact with single drop down items, while the extended controls (DropDownItemsButton, SplittItemsButton) are based on an ItemsControl and can thus be with multiple drop down items (in a similar fashion as a standard WPF ComboBox or ListBox control).
