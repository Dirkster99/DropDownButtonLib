#Overview#

This project includes some bugfixes to the original implementation and extends the original controls:

- DropDownButton, SplitButton

with:

- DropDownItemsButton, SplitItemsButton

controls. The original implementation (DropDownButton, SplitButton) can be used to drop down and interact with
single drop down items, while the extended controls (DropDownItemsButton, SplittItemsButton) are based on an
an *ItemsControl* and can thus be used with multiple drop down items (in a similar fashion as a *ComboBox* or *ListBox*).
